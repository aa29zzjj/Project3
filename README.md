# 95-702 Distributed Systems For Information Systems Management
## Project 3 Blockchain and Signatures       Spring 2025


Assigned: Monday, February 24, 2025
Due Monday, March 17, 2025 at 2:00 pm

### Important Note

Place your email address and full name at top of each source code file.

### Principles

One of our primary objectives in this course is to make clear the fundamental
distinction between functional and nonfunctional characteristics of distributed
systems. The functional characteristics describe the business or organizational
purpose of the system. The non-functional characteristics affect the quality of
the system. Is it fast? Does it easily interoperate with others? Is it fault
tolerant? Is it reliable and secure?

In this project, we will illustrate an important nonfunctional characteristic
of blockchain technology - its tamper evident design. We will build a stand-alone
blockchain in Task 0 and a distributed system where a remote client interacts with
a blockchain API in Task 1. In Task 2, we will work with digital signatures.


### Prerequisites

This prerequisite section discusses Gson. This same material appeared in the Appendix of Project 2. If you have already worked through that appendix, you may safely skip this prerequisite section.

In this project we will be using the Gson class to parse JSON messages. In this prerequisite section, there is guidance on setting up Gson in Intellij. JSON is a popular data format. It competes with XML. Either JSON or XML is appropriate to transfer textual data from one machine to another. Be sure to review the JSON grammar at www.json.org.

0. Create a new project named TestGsonProject and select "Maven" as the build system.
1. Edit the pom.xml file and include this XML element at the end of the file (before the closing project tag).
```
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>
        <artifactId>gson</artifactId>
        <version>2.9.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>

```
2. Select File/Project Structure/Libraries/+/From Maven/.
   Using the search bar, search for com.google.code.gson.
   And then select com.google.code.gson:2.9.0.

3. Include the following import in your source code:

```
import com.google.gson.Gson;
```    

4. Test by compiling and running the following program (you may need to add a package):

```
import com.google.gson.Gson;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
        Gson gson = new Gson();
        System.out.println("Gson is available!");
    }
}
```

5. Suppose we have a message object that we want to serialize to JSON. Why do this?
We may want to transmit the data over a network in an interoperable and textual way.

```
package org.example;
import com.google.gson.Gson;

class Message {
    String name;
    int id;
    public Message(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a message
        Message msg = new Message("Alice", 30);
        // Create a Gson object
        Gson gson = new Gson();
        // Serialize to JSON
        String messageToSend = gson.toJson(msg);
        // Display the JSON string
        System.out.println(messageToSend);
    }
}
```

6. Suppose we receive a message as a JSON string. We may want to deserialize
the JSON string to a Java object. Why do this? This is a huge convenience.
We do not have to parse the message ourselves.

```
package org.example;
import com.google.gson.Gson;

class Message {
    String name;
    int id;
    public Message(String name, int id) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a message
        Message msg = new Message("Alice", 30);
        // Create a Gson object
        Gson gson = new Gson();
        // Serialize to JSON
        String messageToSend = gson.toJson(msg);
        // Display the JSON string
        System.out.println(messageToSend);

        // Suppose we receive the following JSON string from a network or file.
        // Double quotes would be used in a real message. Single quotes are used
        // here because we are doing this within a Java program.
        String someJSON = "{'id':45,'name':'Bob'}";
        Message incommingMsg = gson.fromJson(someJSON,Message.class);
        System.out.println(incommingMsg.name);
        System.out.println(incommingMsg.id);

    }
}
```
7. As a warm up exercise, write a program that reads a financial transaction from the keyboard. The transaction
will be expressed as a JSON string. Use Gson to build a Java object from the JSON string. Display the values
within the object and then use Gson to display the Java object in JSON format.

8. It is fine to use a large language model for this exercise. It is also fine to simply code this yourself.

Here is an example execution:
```
Enter a transaction in Json format. Include from, to, and amount.       
{"from":"Mike","to":"Marty","amount":123.50}      This line is entered by the user.
From: Mike                                        Display values within the object
To: Marty
Amount: 123.5
{"from":"Mike","to":"Marty","amount":123.5}       Use Gson to generate the JSON

```

### Project 3 Overview

In Task 0, you will write a blockchain by carefully following the directions found in our JavaDoc:

[See Block JavaDoc](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/95-702/examples/javadoc/blockchaintask0/Block.html).

[See BlockChain Javadoc](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/course/95-702/examples/javadoc/blockchaintask0/BlockChain.html).

Note that the Javadoc describes writing "data" or a "transaction" to the blockchain. In this project, our "data" or "transaction" will be simple statements transferring "DSCoin" from one player to another.

The Javadoc describes two classes that you need to write - Block.java and BlockChain.java.

In Task 1, you will distribute the application that you created in Task 0. You will write a client server application. The interaction between the client and the server will be with JSON messages (using Gson) over TCP sockets. This is similar to what you did in Project 2 but here we are using TCP rather than UDP.

You will be submitting complete Java programs and console screen interactions on a single PDF file. These should be clearly labelled as described below.

You will also be submitting three IntelliJ projects as three zip files.
See the very end of this document for a precise description of what needs to be submitted.

Documenting code is important. Be sure to provide comments in your code explaining what the code is doing and why.

Be sure to separate concerns when appropriate. It is fine to add methods that you feel are appropriate.

Be sure to include comments within your methods.

Data validation (of user input) is very important but we are not doing that here.

Any code from external sources, e.g., stack overflow or a large language model (LLM), **must be clearly cited with a URL or, in the case of an LLM, a comment saying what tool it is that you are using**.

Note that if you do use code from an external source or an LLM, you are still responsible for that code. That is, you may be asked questions about the code on exams. You will not have access to stack overflow or an LLM on exams.


## Task 0 A Standalone Blockchain Simulator

Write a solution to Task 0 by studying the Javadoc provided (Block.java and BlockChain.java). The logic found in Task 0 will be reused in Task 1.

The execution of Task 0, a non-distributed stand-alone program, will look like the following interaction. As part of the submission of Task 0, you must turn in the output from the console - use copy and paste. The execution will appear similar to the one below.

Label this first section ***Task 0 Execution*** in your PDF. Of course, your code - not mine - will produce the console interaction.

The order of the name value pairs within a JSON message is not important. It is fine if your order differs from mine.

## Task 1 A Client Server Blockchain Simulator

The client side execution of Task 1 will appear exactly the same as in Task 0. The primary difference will be that, behind the scenes, there will be a client server interaction using JSON over TCP sockets. The blockchain will exist on the server. It will be constructed there and the client will make requests for operations over a TCP socket. The client will be focused on driving the menu driven interaction and communicating with the server on the backend. If the client exits, the server will still handle new requests with the existing blockchain intact.

Here is a TCP server from the Coulouris text. It listens on port 777. Run this before running the client.

```
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class EchoServerTCP {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        Socket clientSocket = null;
        try {
            int serverPort = 7777; // the server port we are using

            // Create a new server socket
            ServerSocket listenSocket = new ServerSocket(serverPort);

            /*
             * Block waiting for a new connection request from a client.
             * When the request is received, "accept" it, and the rest
             * the tcp protocol handshake will then take place, making
             * the socket ready for reading and writing.
             */
            clientSocket = listenSocket.accept();
            // If we get here, then we are now connected to a client.

            // Set up "in" to read from the client socket
            Scanner in;
            in = new Scanner(clientSocket.getInputStream());

            // Set up "out" to write to the client socket
            PrintWriter out;
            out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream())));

            /*
             * Forever,
             *   read a line from the socket
             *   print it to the console
             *   echo it (i.e. write it) back to the client
             */
            while (true) {
                String data = in.nextLine();
                System.out.println("Echoing: " + data);
                out.println(data);
                out.flush();
            }

        // Handle exceptions
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IO Exception:" + e.getMessage());

        // If quitting (typically by you sending quit signal) clean up sockets
        } finally {
            try {
                if (clientSocket != null) {
                    clientSocket.close();
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // ignore exception on close
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Here is a TCP client from the Coulouris text. It makes visits to port 7777. Run this after running the server.

```
import java.net.*;
import java.io.*;

public class EchoClientTCP {

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // arguments supply hostname
        Socket clientSocket = null;
        try {
            int serverPort = 7777;
            clientSocket = new Socket(args[0], serverPort);

            BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(clientSocket.getInputStream()));
            PrintWriter out = new PrintWriter(new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(clientSocket.getOutputStream())));


            BufferedReader typed = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
            String m;
            while ((m = typed.readLine()) != null) {
                out.println(m);
                out.flush();
                String data = in.readLine(); // read a line of data from the stream
                System.out.println("Received: " + data);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IO Exception:" + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            try {
                if (clientSocket != null) {
                    clientSocket.close();
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                // ignore exception on close
            }
        }
    }
}

```

Your Task 1 client will be named ClientTCP.java ad your Task1 server will be named ServerTCP.java.

You are required to design and use two JSON messages types - a message to encapsulate
requests from the client and a message to encapsulate responses from the server. The server side display will
show each request message (received from the client -in JSON) and each response message (being sent to the client - in JSON).

In Project 2, you were provided with the structure for request and response messages. In Project 3, we are asking that you design your own request and response messages.

You should have a class named RequestMessage and a class named ResponseMessage to encapsulate the JSON data. You need to include these classes in your submission. You will use the RequestMessage class on both the client and the server. And, you will use the ResponseMessage class on both the client and the server.

Use the following four labels in your single PDF:

**Task 1 Client Side Execution**

Copy and paste your client side console. This will appear as in Task 0.

**Task 1 Server Side Execution**

Here, we will see the request and response messages in JSON format. We will also see the number of
blocks on the chain after each visit.

```

## Task 2 RSA Digital Signatures

## Task 2 illustrates client authentication using signatures. Name the IntelliJ project "Project3Task2".

Before starting this task, study the three programs below. RSAExample.java shows how you can generate RSA keys in Java. ShortMessageSign.java and ShortMessageVerify.java shows you how you can sign and veify the signature on very small messages.

This Task is modeled after the way an Ethereum blockchain client signs requests. In Ethereum, each request to execute a transaction costs gas. That is, the sender has to pay some amount of Eth for resources used. In Ethereum, each client that wants to to execute a transactions must provide an identifier so that a deduction can be made from his or her account.

Make the following modifications to your work in Task 1.

0. Rename the files and call them "SigningClientTCP.java" and "VerifyingServerTCP.java".

1. As before, the client will be interactive and menu driven. It will transmit requests to the server, along with an ID computed in 3 below, and provide an option to exit.

2. We want to send signed request from the client. Each time the client program runs, it will create new RSA public and private keys and **display** these keys to the user. See the RSAExample.java program below for guidance on how to build these keys. It is fine to use the code that you find in RSAExample.java (with citations, of course). After the client (SigningClientTCP.java) creates and displays these keys, it interacts with the user and the server (VerifyingServerTCP).

3. The client&#39;s ID will be formed by taking the least significant 20 bytes of the hash of the client&#39;s public key. Note: an RSA public key is the pair e and n. Prior to hashing, you will combine these two integers with concatenation. The ID is computed in the client code. As in Bitcoin or Ethereum, the user's ID is derived from the public key.

4. The client will also transmit its public key with each request. Again, note that this key is a combination of e and n. These values will be transmitted in the clear and will be used by the server to verify the signature.

5. Finally, the client will sign each request. So, by using its private key (d and n), the client will encrypt the hash of the message it sends to the server. The signature will be added to each request. It is very important that the big integer created with the hash (before signing) is positive. RSA does not work with negative integers. See details in the code of ShortMessageSign.java and ShortMessageVerify.java below. You may use this code if cited.

6. The server will make two checks before servicing any client request. First, does the public key (included with each request) hash to the ID (also provided with each request)? Second, is the request properly signed? If both of these are true, the request is carried out on behalf of the client. The server will behave as it did in Task 1. Otherwise, the server returns the message &quot;Error in request&quot;.

7. By studying ShortMessageVerify.java and ShortMessageSign.java you will know how to compute a signature. Your solution, however, will not use the short message approach as exemplified there. Note that we are not using any Java crypto API&#39;s that abstract away the details of signing.

8. We will use SHA-256 for our hash function h(). To clarify further:

The client will send the id: last20BytesOf(h(e+n)), the public key: e and n in the clear, the request in the clear, and the signature E(h(all prior tokens),d). The signature is thus an encrypted hash. It is encrypted
using d and n - the client&#39;s private key. E represents standard RSA encryption. The function h(e+n) is the SHA-256 hash of e concatenated with n.

During one client session, the ID will always be the same. If the client quits and restarts, it will have a new ID. The server is left running and survives client restarts.

As before, use a **proxy design** to encapsulate the communication code.

Produce a screen shot (or copy and paste) illustrating a successful execution and submit the interaction in the single pdf file as described at the end of this document. The screen shot (or copy and paste) will show three different clients interacting with the server using three distinct ID&#39;s.

When signing a message using JSON, the normal practice is to construct a JSON message like this:

{"NameOfField1":"Value1", "NameOfField2":"Value2","signature":"value of signature"}

The signature value is an encrypted hash of the concatenation of all of the values (except the signature value) and does not include the names. This should make signature creation and verification easier to do. So, in this example, you would really only sign "Value1" + "Value2". You would not include "NameOfField1" or "NameOfField2" in the computation of the signature.


:checkered_flag:**On your single pdf, make a copy of your client side code and label it clearly as "Project3Task2SigningClient".**

:checkered_flag:**On your single pdf, make a copy of your server side code and label it clearly as "Project3Task2VerifyingServer".**

:checkered_flag:**Take a screenshot (or copy and paste) of your client console screen. Show a single client interacting with the server using the keys generated when the client code is run. All of the client's key material must be displayed on the client side console. Display the private key (d and n) and the public key (e and n). The client will perform a few operations on the server. Each request will be signed. On your single pdf, label this screenshot as "Project3Task2ClientConsole".**

:checkered_flag:**Take a screenshot of your server console screen. It will show each visitor's public key material (e and n) and whether or not the signature is verified. On your single pdf, label this screenshot as "Project3Task2ServerConsole". You will show three different visitors who are all verified.**

**Task 2 Grading Rubric 20 Points**

Rubric:
1. All messages are signed by the client and verified on the server. 10 points.
3. The JSON message being sent to the server is well designed and is represented in RequestMessage.java: 2 Points
4. The JSON message being sent from the server to the client is well designed and is represented in ResponseMessage.java: 3 Points.
5. Separation of concerns is well done with a proxy design. : 2 points.
6. The single PDF file includes sections correctly labelled: 3 Points.
